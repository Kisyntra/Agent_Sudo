# Agent_Sudo Command Reference

A complete map of the Agent_Sudo command surface, so you can understand what each
command does without reading source. Two executables ship with the package:

- **`agent-sudo`** — the CLI for setup, approvals, delegation, and audit.
- **`agent-sudo-mcp`** — the stdio MCP server an agent client (Claude Code, Codex
  CLI, Claude Desktop) actually connects to. This is the live enforcement point;
  the `agent-sudo` CLI manages and inspects the state around it.

> All examples are illustrative. `agent-sudo --version` and `agent-sudo <cmd> --help`
> are the source of truth for flags on your installed version. Nothing here changes
> behavior.

## Command categories at a glance

| Category | Commands |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Onboarding** | `setup`, `demo`, `doctor`, `init-approval`, `workspace`, `context` |
| **Operational** (live use) | `agent-sudo-mcp`, `pending`, `approve`, `deny`, `approval-helper`, `delegate` |
| **Audit / investigation** | `audit list`, `audit review`, `audit trace`, `verify-audit`, `verify-routing` |
| **Troubleshooting** | `doctor`, `context`, `verify-routing` |
| **Administrative** | `init-approval`, `workspace set`, `delegate revoke`, `upgrade-local` |
| **Integration / dev** | `check`, `run`, `generic-check`, `generic-run`, `hermes-check`, `codex-check` |

Some commands appear in more than one category (e.g. `doctor` is both onboarding
and troubleshooting); they are listed under their primary use.

## Typical user workflow

1. **Install & verify** — `pipx install agent-sudo-mcp`, then `agent-sudo doctor`.
2. **Generate client config** — `agent-sudo setup` (interactive) or
   `agent-sudo setup <client>`.
3. **(Optional) enable interactive approvals** — `agent-sudo init-approval`.
4. **Connect** your MCP client; it launches `agent-sudo-mcp`.
5. **Operate** — when a sensitive action is pending: `agent-sudo pending` →
   `agent-sudo approve <id>`; for unattended access, `agent-sudo delegate create`.
6. **Investigate** — `agent-sudo audit list <log>`, `audit trace <token>`,
   `verify-audit <log>`.

## Onboarding

### `setup`
- **Purpose:** print a pasteable MCP config for a client runtime.
- **Example:** `agent-sudo setup` (interactive picker) or `agent-sudo setup codex`.
- **When to use:** first-time wiring of Claude Code / Codex CLI / Claude Desktop.
- **Common mistakes:** running it in CI with no target — it lists targets and exits
  non-zero rather than prompting; name the target explicitly in scripts.

### `eval`
- **Purpose:** the one-shot first-value demonstration — runs blocked → delegated →
  allowed-once → denied → audit-verified and prints a PASS/FAIL ladder plus the
  audit-log path.
- **Example:** `agent-sudo eval` · `agent-sudo eval --json` · `agent-sudo eval --output-dir ./eval-out`
- **When to use:** immediately after install to confirm the whole boundary works; it's
  the recommended first command and is CI-safe (exit 0 on pass, non-zero on fail).
- **Common mistakes:** expecting it to touch your real `~/.agent-sudo` — it runs in a
  temporary directory by default (use `--output-dir` for a stable location). The printed
  `Next:` command inspects that same audit log.

### `demo`
- **Purpose:** run a built-in, offline demo of allow/deny/audit decisions.
- **Example:** `agent-sudo demo`
- **When to use:** a quick look at individual decisions; for the full value loop use
  `agent-sudo eval`.
- **Common mistakes:** treating it as a config check — it uses a temporary audit log,
  not your real one.

### `doctor`
- **Purpose:** report local readiness (Python version, policy, writable audit/
  delegation stores, approval config).
- **Example:** `agent-sudo doctor`
- **When to use:** right after install, or when something isn't working.
- **Common mistakes:** expecting it to validate your MCP client config — it checks the
  local Agent_Sudo install, not the client wiring (use `verify-routing` for that).

### `init-approval`
- **Purpose:** create (or reset) the local passphrase used to approve **critical**
  actions.
- **Example:** `agent-sudo init-approval`
- **When to use:** only if you want interactive human approval; the delegation flow
  does not need it.
- **Common mistakes:** re-running it to "fix" something — a reset **revokes all
  delegations and cancels pending approvals** (audit log is preserved).

### `workspace`  (`set` / `show`)
- **Purpose:** persist the project directory MCP clients should treat as the workspace.
- **Example:** `agent-sudo workspace set /abs/path/to/project` · `agent-sudo workspace show`
- **When to use:** with GUI clients (e.g. Claude Desktop) that launch the server from
  `/`, so context detection still resolves your project.
- **Common mistakes:** passing a relative path; use an absolute directory that exists.

### `context`
- **Purpose:** print the detected runtime workspace context as JSON.
- **Example:** `agent-sudo context --workspace /abs/path/to/project`
- **When to use:** to confirm what workspace the server will resolve.
- **Common mistakes:** confusing it with `workspace show` — `context` *detects/resolves*
  (cwd, env, persisted config); `workspace show` reports only the *persisted* value.

---

## Operational (live use)

### `agent-sudo-mcp`  (separate executable)
- **Purpose:** the stdio MCP server your agent client connects to; the live point where
  tool calls are gated, classified, and logged.
- **Example:** configured by your client; manually:
  `agent-sudo-mcp --audit-log ~/.agent-sudo/mcp-audit.jsonl --delegations-file ~/.agent-sudo/delegations.json --workspace /abs/project`
- **When to use:** always, indirectly — it runs whenever your MCP client is active.
- **Common mistakes:** omitting `--delegations-file` (delegations are then ignored) or
  leaving `--audit-log` relative (the log lands somewhere `audit list` won't read). See
  [MCP Server Setup](integrations/mcp_server_setup.md).

### `pending`
- **Purpose:** list active pending approval requests.
- **Example:** `agent-sudo pending`
- **When to use:** when the client reports `approval_required` and you need the id.
- **Common mistakes:** none significant. (Note: `agent-sudo approvals list` does the same
  thing — see [Overlaps](#overlapping--redundant-commands).)

### `approve` / `deny`
- **Purpose:** approve or deny a pending request by id.
- **Example:** `agent-sudo approve <approval_id>` · `agent-sudo deny <approval_id>`
- **When to use:** to release (or reject) a gated action.
- **Common mistakes:** trying to approve a **critical** action without having run
  `init-approval` (the passphrase is required); letting the request expire (default TTL
  120s) before approving.

### `approval-helper`
- **Purpose:** a guided terminal flow for handling pending requests.
- **Example:** `agent-sudo approval-helper`
- **When to use:** for an interactive approve/deny loop; the macOS
  `--open-approval-terminal` flag launches this automatically.
- **Common mistakes:** invoking with `--auto-opened` by hand — that's the minimal
  auto-close mode meant for the auto-spawned window.

### `delegate`  (`create` / `list` / `revoke`)
- **Purpose:** issue, list, and revoke scoped, self-expiring delegation tokens.
- **Example:**
  `agent-sudo delegate create --actor codex --allow-action run_shell_command --allow-path pwd --ttl-seconds 300 --max-uses 1 --critical --reason "demo"`
- **When to use:** to grant narrow unattended authority instead of approving each action.
- **Common mistakes:** writing the token to a different `--delegations-file` than the MCP
  server reads — they must match, or the token is ignored (`delegate create` warns when
  it falls back to the default store).

---

## Audit / investigation

### `audit list`
- **Purpose:** show recent decisions as a filterable table (with a provenance origin column).
- **Example:** `agent-sudo audit list` · `agent-sudo audit list ~/.agent-sudo/mcp-audit.jsonl --since 24h --non-allow`
- **When to use:** to review what the agent did and how each call was decided.
- **Common mistakes:** none. The command defaults to `~/.agent-sudo/mcp-audit.jsonl` (falling back to a project-local `.agent-sudo/mcp-audit.jsonl` if present in the current working directory).

### `audit review`
- **Purpose:** verify the chain, summarize recent decision counts, and list non-ALLOW rows
  for a window.
- **Example:** `agent-sudo audit review` · `agent-sudo audit review --since 24h`
- **When to use:** a quick "what needs attention recently" pass.
- **Common mistakes:** the flag is `--since` (e.g. `30m`, `24h`, `7d`), not `--window`.

### `audit trace`
- **Purpose:** trace one delegation token's lifecycle (scope, uses, expiry) across the log.
- **Example:** `agent-sudo audit trace <token_id>` · `agent-sudo audit trace <token_id> ~/.agent-sudo/mcp-audit.jsonl`
- **When to use:** to investigate how a specific delegation was used or denied.
- **Common mistakes:** expecting exact causal counts — store-state and log-observed
  quantities are reported separately and not claimed as definitive.

### `verify-audit`
- **Purpose:** verify the SHA-256 hash chain of an audit log (tamper detection).
- **Example:** `agent-sudo verify-audit` · `agent-sudo verify-audit ~/.agent-sudo/mcp-audit.jsonl`
- **When to use:** to prove the log hasn't been edited.
- **Common mistakes:** confusing it with `verify-routing` (below) — different question.

### `verify-routing`
- **Purpose:** report observed evidence of whether actions are flowing *through*
  Agent_Sudo (config state, audit activity, decision histogram, hash-chain integrity,
  best-effort client wiring).
- **Example:** `agent-sudo verify-routing`
- **When to use:** to sanity-check that your client is actually routed through the engine.
- **Common mistakes:** reading it as a guarantee — it reports observed signals and
  explicitly **cannot** certify complete protection. (It defaults to checking both the
  current directory and `~/.agent-sudo/mcp-audit.jsonl`.)

---

## Troubleshooting

`doctor`, `context`, and `verify-routing` (documented above) are the troubleshooting
trio: **`doctor`** for local install health, **`context`** for workspace resolution, and
**`verify-routing`** for "is my client actually protected?".

---

## Administrative

`init-approval` (passphrase lifecycle), `workspace set` (persisted workspace),
`delegate revoke` (pull a token), and **`upgrade-local`** below.

### `upgrade-local`
- **Purpose:** safely upgrade a local source-checkout install of Agent_Sudo.
- **Example:** `agent-sudo upgrade-local --check` (report only) · `agent-sudo upgrade-local`
- **When to use:** maintaining a `pip install -e .` checkout; **not** needed for `pipx`
  installs (use `pipx upgrade agent-sudo-mcp`).
- **Common mistakes:** running with local edits — it cleans generated artifacts unless you
  pass `--allow-dirty`.

## Integration / dev (single-tool-call evaluation)

These commands evaluate a **single tool-call JSON file** through the policy engine. They
are for embedding/testing the engine, not day-to-day operation. The argument is a path to
a JSON file you create (there is no inline-string form). Run `agent-sudo <command> --help`
to see the expected schema with a copy-pasteable example.

| Command | Input | Behavior |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `check` | universal `ActionRequest` JSON | classify + decide, **dry-run** (no execution) |
| `run` | universal `ActionRequest` JSON | evaluate **with** approvals + audit logging |
| `generic-check` | universal tool-call JSON | normalize → classify, dry-run |
| `generic-run` | universal tool-call JSON | normalize → evaluate (`--dry-run` available) |
| `hermes-check` | Hermes native tool-call JSON | normalize → classify, dry-run |
| `codex-check` | Codex native tool-call JSON | normalize → classify, dry-run |

- **Example** (self-contained — works from any directory, no repo checkout):

  ```bash
  cat > /tmp/agent-sudo-tool-call.json <<'EOF'
  {"actor": "agent-a", "agent_type": "generic", "source": "user",
   "source_trust": "USER_DIRECT", "tool": "unknown_tool", "action": "inspect",
   "target": "/home/user/project", "payload_summary": "Inspect example project"}
  EOF
  agent-sudo generic-check /tmp/agent-sudo-tool-call.json
  ```
- **When to use:** wiring the engine into a runtime/adapter and verifying classification.
- **Common mistakes:** expecting these to honor delegations — the `*-check` variants are
  dry-run classifiers and do not consult a delegation store; live enforcement happens in
  `agent-sudo-mcp`.

---

## Discoverability notes

### Hidden options
- `workspace set --config` and `workspace show --config` are hidden (`argparse.SUPPRESS`)
  — internal test hooks, not for general use. No hidden *commands* exist; everything is
  listed in `agent-sudo --help`.

### Poorly documented (before this reference)
- `check`, `hermes-check`, `codex-check` had little user-facing documentation and an
  undocumented input schema (mitigated by the `--help` schema examples and the table above).
- `context` vs `workspace show` distinction was not stated anywhere.

### Overlapping / redundant commands
- **`pending` ≡ `approvals list`** — both list pending approval requests. `pending` is the
  documented shorthand; `approvals list` is redundant.
- **`check` / `generic-check` / `hermes-check` / `codex-check`** overlap — same operation,
  different input adapter. Likewise **`run` / `generic-run`**.
- **`verify-audit` vs `audit review`** — `audit review` also verifies the chain, so the two
  overlap on integrity checking (`audit review` adds summary + non-ALLOW rows).
- **`verify-audit` vs `verify-routing`** — confusable names, different questions (log
  integrity vs. routing evidence).

### Obsolete
- None confirmed obsolete. `approvals list` is the strongest consolidation candidate
  (fully covered by `pending`). Any change there is out of scope for this reference, which
  documents current behavior only.
